# Weather App

Web app that shows current weather and a five day forecast.

I made this for an interview project with my current employer. View 
[Typing Party](https://github.com/AdamLoe/TypingParty)
or
[Expenditure Approval](https://github.com/AdamLoe/expenditure-approval)
if you want to see a real project.

## Bugs

**Geolocation**: Sometimes HTML Geolocation takes forever to get the users location.
This blocks the app from automatically detecting the users location and displaying at the start sometimes.
